What are short-term loans?

Short-term loans are loans with little to no collateral that are to be repaid in a year or less, sometimes weeks or months. Most require proof of employment with a certain monthly salary, a bank account and a driverâ€™s license or another form of ID. Because there is often no collateral and the credit requirements are lower, these loans charge a higher interest rate (up to 400 percent) and may have other fees and penalties.
