How do they work?

Many of these loans can be applied for and received quickly. You simply submit your application (usually online) and proof of employment or other credit information. Then the company reviews it and offers you the loan terms, including the amount, interest rates, fees and repayment schedule. If you agree, you sign the contract and get your money, often in as little as 24 hours.
